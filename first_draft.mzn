% Define the input data
int: m; % number of couriers
int: n; % number of items
array[1..m] of int: l; % maximum load size for each courier
array[1..n] of int: s; % size of each item
array[1..n+1, 1..n+1] of int: D; % distance matrix
% Note: D[i,j] is the distance between distribution point i and distribution point j

% Define the decision variables
array[1..m, 1..n] of var 0..1: x; % x[i,j] is 1 if item j is assigned to courier i, 0 otherwise
array[1..m, 1..n+1] of var 1..n+1: tour; % tour[i,k] is the k-th distribution point visited by courier i

% Define the constraints
constraint forall(i in 1..m) (
    sum(j in 1..n) (x[i,j] * s[j]) <= l[i] % each courier's load must be less than or equal to its maximum load
);
constraint forall(j in 1..n) (
    sum(i in 1..m) (x[i,j]) = 1 % each item must be assigned to exactly one courier
);
constraint forall(i in 1..m) (
    tour[i,1] = n+1 /\ tour[i,n+1] = n+1 % each courier's tour must start and end at the origin point
);
constraint forall(i in 1..m, k in 2..n+1) (
    tour[i,k] != n+1 % each courier's tour must visit a customer location before returning to the origin point
);
constraint forall(i in 1..m, k in 1..n+1) (
    tour[i,k] in 1..n+1 % each courier's tour must visit a valid distribution point
);
constraint forall(i in 1..m, j in 1..n, k in 1..n) (
    tour[i,k] = j -> x[i,j] = 1 % if item j is visited by courier i, then it must be assigned to courier i
);

);
constraint minimize(max([sum(k in 2..n+1) (D[tour[i,k-1],tour[i,k]]) | i in 1..m])); % minimize the maximum distance traveled by any courier
